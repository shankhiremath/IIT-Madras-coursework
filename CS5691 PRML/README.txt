#Q5 
This folder contains BE18B006_BE18B011.ipynb file 
and BE18B006_BE18B011.py files to perform classification using three binary bayes classifiers.
It plots the given input data and its decision boundaries. It also plots their respective ROC curves.
Input file format: file_name.npz
## Usage

```bash
python be18b006_be18b011.py
```

# Q6
This folder contains BE18B006_BE18B011_genes.ipynb file which takes assignmentcounts.csv 
to identify the best fitting parametric model for each gene, perform MLE estimations assuming 
normal distribution as the best fitting model for all genes. It also plots mean vs variance 
diagnostic plot.

## Requirements

```bash
pip install ipynb
```
# full import 
```bash
ipynb.fs.full.BE18B006_BE18B011_genes
```
